# Gini vs. Permutation Importance Comparison

The identical ranking between the two methods, with logP being the most influential by far, continues to suggest that hydrophobicity is the primary indicator for solubility in this dataset, with molecular complexity, size, and polarity being runners-up.

No apparent bias in the random forest from tree-splitting or correlation seems to be present, and behavior across shuffles appears negligible, with small permutation standard deviations for relative to each descriptor's importance value.

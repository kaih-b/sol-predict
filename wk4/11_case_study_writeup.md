# Case Study

## Molecule Used

The case study focused on the molecule which had the greatest magnitude of error between its predicted logS and experimental logS from the Delaney ESOL dataset. The molecule, anthraquinone, has the following SMILES identifier:

**O=C1c2ccccc2C(=O)c3ccccc13**

## Model Behavior

For anthraquinone, the tuned RF model predicted a logS value of -2.85, which differs from the Delaney dataset's experimental logS value of -5.19 by a magnitude of 2.34. This represents an error

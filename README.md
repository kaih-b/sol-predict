# SolPredict

An undergraduate ChemBE independent research project aiming to predict the solubility of organic compounds from molecular descriptors using Python-based machine learning techniques.

## About

The objective is to explore structure–property relationships, build regression models, and evaluate predictive accuracy.

The project serves as an introduction to data-driven chemical engineering workflows — combining Python, machine learning, data science, chemical information.

## Goals
- Develop ML models that predict solubility from structural features  
- Compare the performance of multiple models 
- Familiarize self with accepeted research procedures
- Familiarize self with long-term, self-guided projects
- Troubleshoot both coding and process roadblocks
- Prepare self for future projects involving applications of ML and data science to chemical problems
